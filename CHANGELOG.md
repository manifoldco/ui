  region changes.

## [0.5.1] - 2019-08-01

### Removed

- `resource-label` removed from `<manifold-data-product-logo>` in favor of new
  `<manifold-data-resource-logo>` component

## [0.5.0] - 2019-07-25

### Added

- Added a SSO data button and the resource wrapper for ssoing into a resource's product dashboard.
- Added a new CTA slot in the product card for displaying unique cta content.

### Changed

- Changed the `manifold-auth-token` component to now use the shadowcat oauth system rather than only
  use the given token. This enables platforms to now use real authentication.

### Fixed

- Fixed the provision button requiring the label to be set, preventing or automatic label generation
  from working.

## [0.4.3] - 2019-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the rename and deprovision button not behaving properly when used in their resource warpers

## [0.4.2] - 2019-07-16

  from external stylesheets.

### Changed

- Made all the internal attributes optional on the components to make sure TypeScript does not
  complain.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-07-15

### Changed

- Changed how the `manifold-service-card` works to have it fetch the product unless given. This
  allows it to be used standalone or in the `marketplace`.
- ⚠️ `resource-name` renamed to `resource-label` in the following components:
  `<manifold-resource-list>`, `<manifold-resource-plan>`, `<manifold-resource-product>`,
  `<manifold-data-product-logo>`, `<manifold-data-product-name>`,
  `<manifold-data-provision-button>`, `<manifold-data-resource-list>`

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `resource-name` attribute in all the resource components for `resource-label` as to
  be more consistent with the other components and our other codebases.

## 0.3.1 - 2019-07-12

### Added

- New `manifold-resource-product` and `manifold-resource-plan` component to load a resource's
  product and plan card.
- New `manifold-data-deprovision-button` component that allows to deprovision a resource.
- New `manifold-data-rename-button` component that allows to rename a resource.
- New `manifold-credentials` component that allows to see a resource's credentials without needing
  to be in a `resource-container`.
- New `manifold-mock-resource` component that allows to mock a `resource-container` with a fake
  resource.

### Changed

- Changed the input from the `manifold-data-provision-button` to remove the input make it a pure
  button.
- Changed the `manifold-resource-status` component to now display in two different sizes.
- Changed the `manifold-resource-credentials` component to use the standalone `manifold-credentials`
  component.

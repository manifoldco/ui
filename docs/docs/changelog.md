## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Changed the deprovision and rename button to not include a shadow dom root, they can now be styled from external stylesheets.

## [0.4.1]
### Changed
- Made all the internal attributes optional on the components to make sure TypeScript does not complain.

## [0.4.0]
### Deprecated
- Deprecated the `resource-name` attribute in all the resource components for `resource-label` as to be more consistent with the other components and our other codebases.

### Changed
- Changed how the `manifold-service-card` works to have it fetch the product unless given. This allows it to be used standalone or in the `marketplace`.

## [0.3.1]
### Added
- New `manifold-resource-product` and `manifold-resource-plan` component to load a resource's product and plan card.
- New `manifold-data-deprovision-button` component that allows to deprovision a resource.
- New `manifold-data-rename-button` component that allows to rename a resource.
- New `manifold-credentials` component that allows to see a resource's credentials without needing to be in a `resource-container`.
- New `manifold-mock-resource` component that allows to mock a `resource-container` with a fake resource.

### Changed
- Changed the input from the `manifold-data-provision-button` to remove the input make it a pure button.
- Changed the `manifold-resource-status` component to now display in two different sizes.
- Changed the `manifold-resource-credentials` component to use the standalone `manifold-credentials` component.

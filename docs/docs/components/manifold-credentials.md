# ðŸ”’ Credentials

Display credentials for a resource. ðŸ”’ Requires [authentication][auth].

The resource label needs to be provided for the component to be able to fetch the resource's
credentials on demand.

```html
<manifold-credentials resource-label="my-resource"></manifold-credentials>
```

## Customizing the buttons

You can pass in your own button or link for the show and hide buttons of the component by passing in
any element with `slot="show-button"` and `slot="hide-button"` as an attribute respectively. [Read
more about slots][slot].

```jsx
<manifold-credentials resource-label="my-resource">
  <MyButton slot="show-button">Show credentials</MyButton>
  <MyButton slot="hide-button">Hide credentials</MyButton>
</manifold-credentials>
```

## No credentials

Occasionally a resource will be authorized without credentials exposed to the user. In those cases
the component will display a message and an SSO button to the user. Both the message and the SSO
button can be customized via [slots][slot].

```jsx
<manifold-credentials resource-label="my-resource">
  <manifold-resource-sso slot="sso-button">SSO into Dashboard</manifold-resource-sso>
  <div slot="no-credentials">
    Access to this resource is authorized without credentials. 
    SSO into the resource dashboard to configure your service.
  </div>
</manifold-credentials>
```

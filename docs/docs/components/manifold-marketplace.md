# Marketplace

A list of all Manifold services.

```html
<manifold-marketplace></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Catalog curation

Our marketplace offers 2 options, either to show all services excluding a
few, or manually specifying the products that should be shown. For either
option there is either the `excludes` or `products` options—use either, but
not both in the same instance.

#### Excludes

Excludes will start with **all products**, but let you specify which ones
you’d like to hide:

```html
<manifold-marketplace excludes="manifold-provider"></manifold-marketplace>
```

#### Products

Conversely, manually specifying products will start with **no products**, and
let you manually specify every product that should be shown.

A common usecase is using `products` in conjuction with `hide-categories` (below).

```html
<manifold-marketplace products="aiven-redis,cloudamqp,iron_cache,iron_mq,memcachier-cache"></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Hide categories

Hiding the categories is a great way to have a more compact display. It’s
recommended to use this if you’re only displaying a few products via
`products` (above):

```html
<manifold-marketplace hide-categories></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Hide search

This hides the search bar (always shown by default).

```html
<manifold-marketplace hide-search></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Hide template cards

Add the `hide-templates` attribute to hide external service template cards
(GitHub, Stripe, etc.). This will also hide their respective categories if no
other products are using them.

```html
<manifold-marketplace hide-templates></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Featuring products

You can add a “Featured” tag to select products by specifing a
comma-separated list:

```html
<manifold-marketplace featured="piio,zerosix"></manifold-marketplace>
```

## Events

This component emits [custom
events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent)
when it updates. To listen to those events, add an event listener either on
the component itself, or `document`:

```js
document.addEventListener('manifold-marketplace-click', { detail } => {
  console.log(detail); // { productLabel: "jawsdb-mysql", productName: "JawsDB MySQL", productId: "234w1jyaum5j0aqe3g3bmbqjgf20p" }
});
```

The following events are emitted:

| Event Name                   | Description                                                                                              | Data                                       |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `manifold-marketplace-click` | Fires whenever a user has clicked on a product.                                                          | `productId`, `productLabel`, `productName` |
| `manifold-template-click`    | Fires whenever a user has clicked on a custom template (assuming it’s not hidden with `hide-templates`). | `category`                                 |

## Navigation

By default, service cards will only emit the `manifold-marketplace-click`
event (above). But it can also be turned into an `<a>` tag by specifying
`product-link-format` and `template-link-format`:

```html
<manifold-marketplace
  product-link-format="/product/:product"
  template-link-format="/template/:template"
></manifold-marketplace>
<!-- <a href="/product/jawsdb-mysql"> -->
```

`:product` will be replaced with the url-friendly slug for the product, as
will `:template` for custom resource templates.

Note that this will disable the custom events unless `preserve-event` is
passed as well.

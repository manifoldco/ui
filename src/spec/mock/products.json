Not only does MySQL code run ‘swimmingly’ on MariaDB, but Maria also adds several enhancements and features to the database you already know and love.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>In addition to any backups you personally create, we automatically take nightly snapshots for single tenant databases. This means that our team can help you restore to a previous point in time.</p><h3>Databites</h3><p>Create, edit, and save reusable queries against your provisioned server. Databites are a custom, zero-hassle reporting solution for your database right out of the box!</p><h3>Scale</h3><p>Regardless of how big of a wave you&#39;re riding, JawsDB makes it easy to scale your database performance.</p><h3>Stay in Control</h3><p>For single tenant plans, we provide you and only you with root credentials — so you have complete control of your server.</p><h3>Data Replication</h3><p>The world doesn&#39;t need to be a scary place, choose a plan that supports failover and your data is replicated to servers in different regions of the world, reducing unexpected downtime.</p>",
